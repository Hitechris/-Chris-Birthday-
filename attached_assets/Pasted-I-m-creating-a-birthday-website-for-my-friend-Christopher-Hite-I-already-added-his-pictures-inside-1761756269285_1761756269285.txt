I’m creating a birthday website for my friend, Christopher Hite.
I already added his pictures inside the folder /public/images.
I want you to build or update the site to include a Bubble Button that launches a fun celebration animation using his pictures, name, and balloons.

🎈 What I want the effect to do:
	•	There should be a fixed button at the bottom of the screen labeled “🎉 Celebrate Christopher!”.
	•	When the user clicks the button:
	1.	Multiple colorful bubbles should float up the screen with smooth CSS/JS animations.
	2.	Some bubbles should randomly display Christopher Hite’s pictures — automatically pulled from the /public/images folder.
	3.	When a bubble pops (either on click or after a few seconds), it should briefly show:
	•	His name: “Happy Birthday Christopher Hite!”
	•	A short message or wish, like “Wishing you endless joy and blessings 🎂”.
	4.	At the same time, balloons float upward in the background to make it festive.
	5.	After the animation (about 8–10 seconds), all bubbles and balloons fade out naturally.

✨ Design & Style
	•	Frontend only — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or React).
	•	No backend, no APIs, no environment variables.
	•	Bright, colorful, and responsive (mobile + desktop).
	•	Birthday theme with balloons, confetti, pastel colors, and maybe a soft background gradient.
	•	Smooth floating, fading, and popping animations.

📁 Assets
	•	Load all pictures dynamically from /public/images (no need to hardcode file names).
	•	Randomize which image appears in each bubble.
	•	Optionally include a background music file in /public/audio/birthday.mp3 with play/pause controls.

🧩 Functionality
	•	The Bubble Button triggers the celebration animation when clicked.
	•	Clicking a bubble pops it and briefly shows “🎉 Happy Birthday Christopher Hite! 🎂”.
	•	Balloons rise behind the bubbles during the effect.
	•	After the animation, the screen resets to its normal state.
	•	Include comments in the code showing where to edit:
	•	Christopher’s name
	•	Messages or wishes
	•	Bubble/balloon colors
	•	Animation duration or speed

🧱 Technical setup
	•	Pure frontend project that runs instantly in Replit or static hosting.
	•	File structure:
